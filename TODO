I really like this piece of code, and I feel like this could be a useful
starting point to make the occasional command line tool. The only thing
you have to modify is cmd.hs below the main definition and the features
list.

That being said, I'd like to work on documenting, clocking, and improving
the efficiency of these operations, as I'd learn about the capabilities of
Haskell's IO system.
