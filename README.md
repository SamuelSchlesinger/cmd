#My excursion into the IO Monad

Very basic template for a command line applet. Copying the directory "bare" should be enough to start creating your own simple command line functionality with different Features embedded in one another. Abstracts the concept of making a feature in a command line program to making a function of type [String] -> IO (). Isn't that what the classic command line application does anywho?
